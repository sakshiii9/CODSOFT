This project is a simple Digital Clock created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
The clock displays the current time, updating every second, and is styled with basic CSS for a clean and minimalistic appearance.

Features-
Real-Time Updates: The clock displays the current time and updates every second.
Simple Design: The layout is clean and minimalistic, focusing on functionality.
Responsive: The clock adjusts its size based on the screen, making it viewable on various devices.

Technologies Used-
HTML: Structure of the clock and page.
CSS: Styling for the clock's appearance.
JavaScript: Logic for updating the time in real-time.

How It Works:
The clock uses JavaScriptâ€™s setInterval function to update the time every second. 
The time is retrieved using the Date object and formatted into a 24-hour format, which is then displayed on the screen.
